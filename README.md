# Beba

This project presents a rental platform for vehicles and property.

## How to Run
- Create a virtual environment
- Install python dependencies `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Find the main application fronted markup in `static/html/index.html` and open it.
- Run the flask server `python server.py`

## Design
- Bootstrap is used to style the frontend and provide forms
- `static/js/index.js` provides interactivity to the frontend and uses axios to make requests to the flask backend
- There is intent to create a cross platform app using flutter (This has yet to be integrated)
